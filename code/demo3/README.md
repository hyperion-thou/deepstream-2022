# Demo3 - Integration with message brokers (e.g. Azure IoT Hub)

Builds on top of demo1 to demonstrate how to send the metadata generated by the DeepStream components to the cloud using messaging components. The destination is configured to be Azure IoT hub but could be Kafka or an AMQP-compliant message broker like RabbitMQ.


Run the demo:

```bash
/opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh \
    ./demo3.yaml \
    ./demo3.parameters.yaml \
    -d /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/config/target_x86_64.yaml
```

Output can be viewed using VLC on `rtsp://<server-ip>:8554/ds-test`.
